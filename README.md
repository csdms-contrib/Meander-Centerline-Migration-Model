# Meander-Centerline-Migration-Model
This repository contains the source codes of the numerical model developed by Bogoni et al. WRR 2017.
Information about the model and the sctructure of input and output files are reported in the file README.pdf


CODE PROPERTIES
* The source code is written in Fortran 77/90 language, thus a Fortran compiler is required (e.g. gfortran).
* The code can be easily compiled through the script compile_unix (for UNIX/MAC) or compile_windows.cmd (for Windows).
* The compressed folder 'input' contains a couple of templates.
* Input files must be into the 'input' folder, located in the same directory of the executable file.
* Folders 'temp' and 'output' are required in the same directory of the executable file.
