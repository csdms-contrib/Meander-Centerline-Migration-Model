# Meander Centerline Migration Model (MCMM)
This repository contains the source codes of the numerical model developed by [Bogoni et al. WRR 2017](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017WR020726/abstract).

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/95902287.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/95902287)

CODE PROPERTIES
* The source code is written in Fortran 77/90 language, thus a Fortran compiler is required (e.g. gfortran).
* The code can be compiled through the script compile_unix (for UNIX/MAC) or compile_windows.cmd (for Windows).
* Information about the model and the sctructure of input and output files are reported in the file _README.pdf_
* The folder _input_ contains a couple of templates.
* Input files must be into the _input_ folder, located in the same directory of the executable file.
* Folders _temp_ and _output_ are required in the same directory of the executable file.
